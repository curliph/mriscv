# RISC-V - Open Source RV32I[C] CPU (Partially Verified)
## About
This is an open source implementation or a 32-bit base integer (with optional 'C' extension) RISC-V CPU.  It has been written in a version of Verilog which is compatible with the open-source ASIC design flow "QFlow".

>Although it appears to be in a functional state it has not been fully verified.
